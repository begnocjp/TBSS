%%%changed pre and post trial times - patrick b.%%%%
for name_i = length(wpms.names)   
    pre_trial = .5;
    post_trial = .5;
    trialfunction = 'Incident_M'; 
    file_ext = 'raw';
    trdat = ccm_trial_definition(wpms,name_i,trialfunction,pre_trial,post_trial,file_ext);
    clear post_trial pre_trial trialfunction
    ccm_ICA(wpms,name_i,trdat);        
end
